# Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7: Utilising efficiency of ResNet, VGG and InceptionNet

## Abstract
In this study we explore the effectiveness of three pretrained convolutional neural network models, ResNet, VGG-Net and InceptionNet, in classifying plant pathologies from images. Our focus is on achieving high categorical accuracy scores for the four categories in the Plant Pathology dataset (Thapa, Ranjita et al., 2020): rust, scab, healthy, and multi-disease. The research investigates the use of these pretrained models to enhance training speed while aiming for superior classification performance. By leveraging these established architectures, we examine the feasibility of accelerating the training process while ensuring high accuracy in plant pathology classification.
